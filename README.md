## Deploy by Using GitHub Actions

There are a few things to get ready for.

* If youâ€™re on the GitHub Free plan, keep your site repository public.
* If you have committed Gemfile.lock to the repository, and your local machine is not running Linux, go the the root of your site and update the platform list of the lock-file:

``` Bash
bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux
```
